# About:
In this project, I implement a hash table using a given framework. This assignment was due on November 4th, 2022.

# Files:
1. Hashing.java

In this implementation, I wrote the code in the insert(), find(), remove(), and toIndex() functions. In this implementation, entries are stored in a linked list. Hashing is done by the toIndex() function, I use multiplicative hashing to produce and index for a given entry of the type Record.

2. Record.java

Class file for the Record object, the object type for the entry being hashed.
